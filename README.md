# amarill
## What is it?
amarill is a template engine for static and dynamic websites.
Instead of template-logic related instructions in the HTML code itself, amarill uses template-logic only written in PHP♦.
This means: you don't need to change the HTML code. Never.
amarill will also never change the HTML code by itself. It writes patches and compiles to a HTML5 document


♦: In future releases amarill will also use YAML and JSON/JSON5.
